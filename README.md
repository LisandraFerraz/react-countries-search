## REST Countries API with color theme switcher

The project is a solution for [Frontend Mentor's challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca). It was build using React 18 with Typescript and Tailwind.

The goal was to fetch data from [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) and display it on screen, giving the user the ability to filter through a search bar and selection filter. Also, part of the challenge was to toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode, which was completed through a self made hook.
